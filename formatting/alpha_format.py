"""
Process fasta files with ligands and cofactors for input into AlphaFold3.

If more than one cofactor or ligand is passed, the program assumes that a json
should be generated for each ligand/cofactor/protein-protein combination. This
kind of combinatorics can get unwieldy very quickly, so use with caution! The
same goes for how many proteins you provide for the many_v_many or one_v_many
options -- the computational complexity of combinations can get prohibitively
high relatively quickly.

This attempts to generalize the includion of multi-subunit proteins; however,
I have not exhaustively tested all the ways they could appear in the data, so
use with caution.
